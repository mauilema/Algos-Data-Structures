### Binary Tree Diameter

## Write a function that takes in a Binary Tree and returns its diameter. The diameter of a binary tree is defined as the length of its longest path, even if that path doesn't pass through the root of the tree.

## A path is a collection of connected nodes in a tree, where no node is connected to more than two other nodes. The length of a path is the number of edges between the path's first node and its last node.

## Each <span>BinaryTree</span> node has an integer <span>value</span>, a <span>left</span> child node, and a <span>right</span> child node. Children nodes can either be <span>BinaryTree</span> nodes themselves or <span>None</span> / <span>null</span>.

<h3>Sample Input</h3>
<pre><span class="CodeEditor-promptParameter">tree</span> =        1
            /   \
           3     2
         /   \ 
        7     4
       /       \
      8         5
     /           \
    9             6
</pre>

<h3>Sample Output</h3>
<pre>6 <span class="CodeEditor-promptComment">// 9 -&gt; 8 -&gt; 7 -&gt; 3 -&gt; 4 -&gt; 5 -&gt; 6</span>
<span class="CodeEditor-promptComment">// There are 6 edges between the</span>
