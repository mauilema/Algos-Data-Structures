## Reverse Words In String

### Given a string of words separated by one or more spaces, write a function that returns a string that has these words in reverse order. For example, given the string <span>"George the cat"</span>, your function should return <span>"cat the George"</span>.

### The constraints in this problem are as follows: a word can contain special characters, punctuation, and numbers. The words in the string will be separated by one or more spaces, and the reversed string must contain the same spaces as the original string. For example, given the string <span>"spaces       7"</span> you would be expected to return <span>"7       spaces"</span>.

### Note: we're <b><i>not</i></b> allowed to use any built-in <span>split</span> or <span>reverse</span> methods/functions. However, you <b><i>are</i></b> allowed to use a built-in <span>join</span> method/function. Additionally, the input string isn't guaranteed to always contain words. 

<h3>Sample Input</h3>
<pre><span class="CodeEditor-promptParameter">string</span> = "Twitch is the best streaming website!"
</pre>

<h3>Sample Output</h3>
<pre>"website! streaming best the is Twitch"
</pre>
