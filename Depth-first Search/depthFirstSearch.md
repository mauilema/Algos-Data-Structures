You're given a Node class that has a name and an array of optional children nodes. When put together, nodes from an acyclic tree-like structure. 
Implement the Depth First Search method on the Node class, which takes in an empty array, traverses the tree using the Depth-first Search approach (traverses the treee from left to right), sotres all of the nodes' names in the input array, and returns it.
