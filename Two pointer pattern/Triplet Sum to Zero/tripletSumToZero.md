## Triplet Sum To Zero

You're given an unsorted array of positive and negative numbers. Write a function that returns a new array that has nested subarrays whose elements are unique triplets that add up to zero. 

<pre>
<h3>Sample Input</h3>
[-3, 0, 1, 2, -1, 1, -2]
<h3>Sample Output</h3>
[[-3, 1, 2], [-2, 0, 2], [-2, 1, 1], [-1, 0, 1]]
<p><h3>There are four unique triplets whose sum is equal to zero.</p>
</pre>

<pre>
<h3>Sample Input</h3>
[-5, 2, -1, -2, 3]
<h3>Sample Output</h3>
[[-5, 2, 3], [-2, -1, 3]]
<p><h3>There are two unique triplets whose sum is equal to zero.</p>
