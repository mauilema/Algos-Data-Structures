## Minimum Characters For Words

### Given an array of words, write a function that returns the smallest array of characters needed to form all of the words. The characters in the output array don't need to be in any particular order.

### Consider this example: The characters <span>["a", "r", "c", "o", "n", "b", "t"]</span> are needed to form the words <span>["arc", "acorn", "bat", "cat"]</span>.

### Notice: the input words will not contain any spaces; however, they can contain punctuation and/or special characters.

<h3>Sample Input</h3>
<pre><span class="CodeEditor-promptParameter">words</span> = ["boat", "beer", "tower", "phone", "greedy!", "z"]
</pre>

<h3>Sample Output</h3>
<pre>["b", "o", "a", "t", "e", "e", "r", "w", "p", "h", "n", "g", "d", "y", "!", "z"]
<span class="CodeEditor-promptComment">// The characters could be ordered differently.</span>
</pre>
